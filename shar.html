<div><p style="text-align:left;"><font face="ink free" size="5px" >In April 2010, I visited Manali along with my family. It was a wonderful experience there. I had first ever seen some of things that I never seen ever before. Catch my memorable experiences through this article. Hereby sharing my experience about visiting that famous hill station.
<h3>Why only Manali ?</h3>

As my family is a great fond of exploring cities all over India. So, now Manali was the only city left in Himachal regions. Apart from Manali, we already Shimla years before. If I talk about Uttarakhand, then hill stations like Nainital, and religious places of Badrinath, Kedarnath were covered in the year 2006 itself. So, we decided to visit Manali this year.

<h3>About Manali</h3>

Manali is located at an approximate height of 8000 ft above the sea level. It is one of the best place to spend summer vacation. It is a prominent honeymoon destination as well. Activities like Trekking in Parvati Valley, skiing in the Solang Valley are popular there. Also, sports like Paragliding, Rafting and Mountaineering in the Pir Panjal Mountain there are one the major attractions of that resort town. One of the major tourist attraction in Manali is the Rohtang Pass which is located at the height of about 13000 ft above the sea level.

<h3>My first day of journey</h3>

My journey started from the Chandigarh Bus Station after we enjoyed some local tourist spots in Chandigarh like Rock Garden and Rose Garden. However, we couldn't find abundant roses in the Rose Garden due to unfavourable climate for roses but still we enjoyed a lot. The total road distance was about 309 kms to Manali. Our bus arrived in the morning from Bus station and we passed several towns on our way like Rupnagar, Bilaspur, Sundernagar and at last Mandi. We completed our journey to Mandi on the first day after taking little intervals in each town. Taking lessons from our previous journeys of Uttarakhand, we took this step to avoid Nausea, Uneasiness problems on our way. We stayed in Mandi on that day and visited local spots there.

<h3>My second day of journey</h3>

Again in the morning, we departed and headed towards Manali which was still 107.8 kms far. And the climate was still the same that we had left behind in Chandigarh. So, we were waiting for that soothing climate of which Manali is famous for. After leaving behind Mandi, we reached Kullu. Nearby Kullu, there is a small town situated Bhuntar where a small airport has been established. Some of the Manali visitors prefer this mode of transport too for saving their time and road problems. After reaching Kullu, Manali was hardly 40 kms far. And the cold breeze of Manali can be easily felt by us. The excitement was getting higher and higher for exploring my dream town. In the evening, we reached there and surprisingly the town welcomed us with showers. However, we immediately managed to check-in a hotel that we booked earlier.

<h3>My third day of journey</h3>

We spent our third day in visiting the famous spots of Manali like Hidimba Temple, Manu Temple, Buddhist Monastery, etc. We too visited local handicrafts store which were quite impressive to see. Also, we enjoyed rafting there in the Beas river.

<h3>My fourth day of journey</h3>

On our fourth day of journey, we headed towards Rohtang Pass. And this peak point gave me that hilarious experience which I hadn't expected after commencing of my journey. On the way to Rohtang Pass, snowfall started suddenly. This was my first experience to snowfall, so I was just amazed. After a couple of kms, the road was blocked due to huge snow on the road. So, we enjoyed there only on the way and returned to the Manali town in the evening. On the next day, we left Manali and reverted our journey back to Chandigarh.

<h3>My Overall Experience</h3>

I think everyone should visit Manali at least once in a life. It is an awesome place to visit for all age groups whether it is a child, or a retired person of the family. There is a plenty of things to enjoy here for each sections of the city. Whether it is a couple or a college friends group, you will get much more enjoyment than any other hill station in India.
